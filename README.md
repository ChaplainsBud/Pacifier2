This is an informative site. There are eight categories. I want to understand:

I. Prevalence

II. Cause

III. Cure 

For example, how often do men beat their partners? IPV

Why do they beat their partner?

How can we cure it? Healing Masculinity, helping men not feel entitled to extra respect and obedience... nor limiting the range of the rainbow of emotions to red: anger. Because in general, it's fathers and sons, grandsons... not women.
